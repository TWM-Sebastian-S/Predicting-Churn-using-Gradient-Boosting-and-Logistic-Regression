# Predicting Churn Using Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression

## This is one of my personal DS/ML/DL projects I've been working in since I started my career as a Data Scientist.

### Project Overview

Machine Learning Project in Python created to find out the key drivers that lead to churn and predict the customer churn.
Project included: 
  - Breakdown Problem Statement
  - EDA & database cleaning
  - Perform Univariate & bi-variate analysis for both numeric and categorical variables
  - Feature engineering and feature selection
  - Prepare the data for modelling
  - Create models using multiple algorithms:
    - Logistic Regression
    - GradientBoosting
  - Perform Hyper-parameter tuning
  - Compare the performance of different models using multiple metrics
  - Recursive feature elimination
